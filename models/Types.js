 * `shop_owner_name`), the location (`location`), and the craft disciplines
 * (`craft_discipline*`).
 * 
 * Workshops also have images associated with them with even more information such

 * field which is an array of image IDs that can be mapped to image metadata
 * objects (see `ImageMeta`).

 *
 * Defines an archive information object.
 * 
 * Primary API endpoint: https://cddl-beirut.herokuapp.com/api/archive
 * 
 * Each archive information object contains information about a response from
 * the archive survey. For responses with visual content, more information such
